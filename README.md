# AMS 595 – Homework 6

This repository contains my implementation of Homework 6 for AMS 595.  
The assignment covers gradient descent, regression methods, logistic classification, and deep learning using a pretrained model.

## Contents

1. Gradient Descent on a 1D Function  
   - Implemented gradient descent for f(x) = sqrt(x² + 5)  
   - Explored convergence behavior using different step sizes  
   - Generated plots for function shape and iteration progress

2. Linear Regression  
   - Created a synthetic 3D dataset  
   - Recovered model parameters using the normal equation  
   - Visualized the fitted regression plane

3. Logistic Regression on Synthetic Data  
   - Built a binary classifier using gradient descent  
   - Generated and plotted the decision boundary

4. Cat vs Non-Cat Image Classification  
   - Fine-tuned a pretrained ResNet18 model  
   - Ran two experiments: original split and modified train/test split  
   - Reported accuracy, classification results, and misclassified images

## How to Run

1. Install required packages:

2. Run the notebooks or scripts in order:
- Q1: Gradient Descent  
- Q2: Step Size Comparison  
- Q3: Regression Plane  
- Q4: Logistic Regression  
- Q5: Image Classification

3. Add your plots to the output folders if needed.

## Results

All plots, metrics, and interpretations are included in the notebook and LaTeX report.  
The project demonstrates optimization methods, regression techniques, and transfer learning using deep neural networks.
